## Tasks

Required Tasks

1. Given a number. Print “odd” if the number is odd and “even” if itʼs even.
   [Task 1 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task1.js).
2. Given two variables, which are the angles of a triangle. Find the third angle of the triangle. (Sum of the angles of a triangle equals 180 degrees)  
   [Task 2 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task2.js).
3. Given a positive integer. Bring the last digit of the number to the beginning. Print the new number. If the last digit of the inserted number is 0, number remains the same.
   [Task 3 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task3.js).
4. Check if a number is a multiple of 3, 5 or 7 and output the appropriate message.

7. Insert a digit and a number. Check whether the digits contains in the number or not.
   [Task 7 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task7.js).
8. Enter a number. Reverse its first and last digits. Print the new number.
   [Task 8 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task8.js).
9. Insert a number. Print ‘yesʼ if the number is prime, ‘noʼ otherwise.
   [Task 9 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task9.js).
10. Given a number n ( n >= 0 ) . Print n Fibonacci number. (Fibonacci th series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ..., ak = ak-1 + ak-2)
    [Task 10 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task_10.js).
11. Insert a number. Calculate product and sum of the digits of the number. If product is divisible by the sum, print the quotient, otherwise print the remainder.  
    [Task 11 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task_11.js).
12. Insert a number. Calculate product and sum of the digits of the number. If product is divisible by the sum, print the quotient, otherwise print the remainder.  
    [Task 12 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task_12.js).
13. Insert a number. Calculate product and sum of the digits of the number. If product is divisible by the sum, print the quotient, otherwise print the remainder.  
    [Task 13 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task_13.js).
14. Insert a number. Calculate product and sum of the digits of the number. If product is divisible by the sum, print the quotient, otherwise print the remainder.  
    [Task 14 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task_14.js).
15. Given an array of strings. Find the strings with maximum and minimum lengths in array. Print the sum of their lengths.
    [Task 15 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task_15.js).
16. Given an array of numbers and a number. Find the index of a first element which is equal to that number. If there is not such a number, that find the index of the first element which is the closest to it.
    [Task 16 Solution](https://github.com/edgarkhudoyan/conditionals-loops/blob/main/task_16.js).
17. Given a sentence as a string. Split it according to space and comma and create an array consisting of the words of the array. The last word should not contain the last . or ! .
